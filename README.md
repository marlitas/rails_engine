## About The Project

Rails Engine was built to practice RESTful API development for a front end consumption. The API uses Active Record and SQL to create business analytics and expose select data and information for a front end team. 

### Learning Goals

* Building and testing a RESTful API
* Active Record/SQL queries
* Serializing data to follow proper JSON contracts
* CRUD functionality



## Tools Used

| Development | Testing       | Gems            |
|   :----:    |    :----:     |    :----:       |
| Ruby 2.7.2  | RSpec         | Pry             |
| Rails 5.2.5 | SimpleCov     | ShouldaMatchers |
| JSON        | FactoryBot    | Faraday         |
| Atom        | Faker         | FastJSON        |
| Git/Github  |       |      |
| Heroku      |          |                 |



## Set Up

1. To clone and run this application, you'll need Ruby 2.7.2 and Rails 2.5.3. Using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) you can install Ruby 2.7.2 (if you don't have it already) with:
```sh
rbenv install 2.7.2
```
2. With rbenv you can set up your Ruby version for a directory and all subdirectories within it. Change into a directory that will eventually contain this repo and then run:
```sh
rbenv local 2.7.2
```
You can check that your Ruby version is correct with `ruby -v`

3. Once you have verified your Ruby version is 2.7.2, check if you have Rails. From the command line:
```sh
rails -v
```
4. If you get a message saying rails is not installed or you do not have version 5.2.5, run
```sh
gem install rails --version 5.2.5
```
5. You may need to quit and restart your terminal session to see these changes show up



## Installation

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your new repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/#{your_github_username}/rails_engine.git
   ```
3. Install gems
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ``` 
4. Setup the database
    ```sh
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```
